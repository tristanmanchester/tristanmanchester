# Tristan Manchester

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tristan - a materials scientist specialising in X-ray imaging techniques.

## About Me

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Diamond Light Source, where I develop novel instrumentation and software tools for synchrotron X-ray imaging. My work focuses on:

- Developing advanced imaging capabilities including X-ray laminography
- Creating deep learning solutions for scientific image analysis
- Building experimental equipment for in situ materials characterisation
- Supporting visiting scientists with data collection and analysis

## Technical Skills

### Scientific Computing
- Python development for data analysis and automation
- Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Image processing and computer vision
- High-performance computing

### Materials Characterisation
- Synchrotron X-ray techniques (tomography, laminography, XANES)
- Laboratory X-ray computed tomography
- Electron microscopy (SEM, FIB)
- In situ experimentation

### Engineering
- CAD design (Fusion 360)
- High-temperature polymer 3D printing
- Experimental apparatus design
- Flow cell fabrication
