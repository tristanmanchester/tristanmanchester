# Tristan Manchester

I'm Tristan - a materials scientist specialising in X-ray imaging techniques.

## About Me

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Diamond Light Source, where I develop novel instrumentation and software tools for synchrotron X-ray imaging. My work focuses on:

- Developing advanced imaging capabilities including X-ray laminography
- Creating deep learning solutions for scientific image analysis
- Building experimental equipment for in situ materials characterisation
- Supporting visiting scientists with data collection and analysis
